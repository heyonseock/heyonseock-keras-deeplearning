알았습니다. 순환 네트워크를 사용하여 시퀸스 데이터를 성공적으로 생성한 애플리케이션은 2016년이 되어서야 주류가 되기 시작했습니다. 하지만 이 기술은 LSTM 알고리즘이 개발된 이래 역사가 꽤 오래되었습니다. 이 알고리즘은 초기에 글자를 하나씩 생성하는 데 사용되었습니다.\n","\n","2002년 더글라스 에크는 스위스의 슈미드 후버의 연구실에서 LSTM을 음악 생성에 처음 적용하여 가능성 있는 결과를 얻었습니다. 에크는 현재 구글 브레인의 연구원으로, 2016년에는 마젠타란 새로운 연구 그룹을 시작했습니다. 여기에는 최신 딥러닝 기술을 사용하여 멋진 음악을 만드는 것에 집중하고 있습니다. 때로는 좋 아이디어가 실현되는데 15년이 걸리기도 합니다.\n","\n","2000년대 후반과 2010년대 초반에 알렉스 그레이브스는 순환 네트워크를 사용하여 시퀸스 데이터를 생성하는 데 아주 중요한 선구적인 일을 했습니다. 특히 2013년에 팬 위치를기록한 시계열 데이터를 사용하여 순환 네트워크와완전 연결 네트워크를 혼합한 네트워크로 사람이 쓴 것 같은 손글씨를 생성했으며, 이 작업이 전환점이 되었습니다. 때맞추어 등장한 특별한 이 신경망 애플리케이션은 꿈을 꾸는 컴퓨터를 상상하게 만들었고, 필자가 케라스를 개발할 때 많은 영감을 주었습니다. 그레이브스는 논문 사전 출판 서버인 아카이브에 업로드한 2013년 레이텍 파일에 비슷한 주석을 남겼습니다. \"시퀸스 데이터를생성하는 것은 컴퓨터가 꿈을 꾸게 하는 것입니다.\" 몇 년이 지난 지금 우리는 이런 애플리케이션을 당연하게 받아들입니다. 그 당시에는 그레이브스의 실험을 보고 가능성만으로 대단한 것이라고 생각하기는 어려웠습니다.\n","\n","그 이후 순환 신경망은 음악 생성, 대화 생성, 이미지 생성, 음성 합성, 분자 설계에 성공적으로 사용되었습니다. 심지어 실제 배우가 캐스팅된 영화의 대본을 만드는 데도 사용되었습니다."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vVJFCP8LOiNs"},"source":["## 시퀸스 데이터를 어떻게 생성할까?\n","\n","딥러닝에서 시퀸스 데이터를 생성하는 일반적인 방법은 이전 토큰을 입력으로 사용해서 시퀸스의 다음 1개 또는 몇 개의 토큰을 예측하는 것입니다. 예를 들어 \"the cat is on ma\"란 입력이 주어지면 다음 글자인 타깃 \"t\"를 예측하도록 네트워크를 훈련합니다. 텍스트 데이터를 다룰 때 토큰은 보통 단어 또는 글자입니다. 이전 토큰들이 주어졌을 때 다음 토큰의 확률을 모델링 할 수 있는 네트워크를 언어 모델이라고 부릅니다. 언어 모델은 언어의 통계적 구조인 잠재 공간을 탐색합니다.\n","\n","언어 모델을 훈련하고 나면 이 모델에서 샘플링을 할 수 있습니다(새로운 시퀸스를 생성합니다). 초기 텍스트 문자열을 주입하고(조건데이터라고 부릅니다)새로운 글자나 단어를 생성합니다(한 번에 여러 번 반복합니다(밑에 그림 참고). 이런 반복을 통해 모델이 훈련한 데이터 구조가 반영된 임의의 길이를 가진 시퀸스를 생성할 수 있습니다. 사람이 쓴 문장과 거의 비슷한 시퀸스를 만듭니다. 이 절의 예제는 LSTM 층을 사용합니다. 텍스트 말뭉치에서 N개의 글자로 이루어진 문자열을 추출하여 주입하고 N+1번째 글자를 예측하도록 훈련합니다. 모델의 출력은 출력 가능한 모든 글자에 해당하는 소프트맥스 값입니다. 즉 다음 글자의 확률 분포입니다. 이 LSTM을 글자 수준의 신경망 언어

생성할 때 다음 글자를 선택하는 방법이 아주 중요합니다. 단순한 방법은 항상 가장 높은 활률을 가진 글자를 선택하는 탐욕적 샘플링입니다. 이 방법은 반복적이고 예상 가능한 문자열을 만들기 때문에 논리적인 언어처럼 보이지 않습니다. 좀 더 흥미로운 방법을 사용하면 놀라운 선택이 만들어집니다. 다음 글자의 확률 분포에서 샘플링하는 과정에 무작위성을 주입하는 방법입니다. 이를 확률적 샘플링이라고 부릅니다 이런 방식을 사용할 경우 'e'가 다음 글자가 될 확률이 0.3이라면, 모델이 30%정도는 이 글자를 선택합니다. 탐욕적 샘플링을 확률적 샘플링르로 설명할 수도 있습니다. 한 글자의 확률이 1이고 나머지 글자는 모두 0인 확률 분포를 가지는 경우입니다.\n","\n","모델의 소프트맥스 출력은 확률적 샘플링에 사용하기 좋습니다. 이따금 샘플링될 것 같지 않은 글자를 샘플링합니다. 훈련 데이터에는 없지만 실제 같은 새로운 단어를 만들어 재미있고 창의적으로 보이는 문장을 생성합니다. 이 전략에는 한 가지 문제가 있습니다. 샘플링 과정에서 무작위성의 양을 조절할 방법이 없습니다\n","\n","왜 무작위성이 크거나 작아야 할까요? 극단적인 경우를 생각해 보죠. 균등 확률 분포에서 다음 글자를 추출하는 완전한 무작위 샘플링이 있습니다. 모든 글자의 확률은 같습니다. 이 구조는 무작위성이 최대입니다. 다른 말로 하면 이 확률 분포는 최대의 엔트로피를 가집니다. 당연하게 흥미로운 것들을 생산하지 못합니다. 반대의 경우 탐욕적 샘플링은 무작위성이 없기 때문에 흥미로운 것을 전혀 만들지 못합니다. 탐욕적 샘플링의 확률 분포는 최소의 엔트로피를 가집니다. 모델의 소프트맥스 출력인 '실제'확률 분포에서 샘플링하는 것은 이 두 극단의 중간에 위치해 있습니다. 중간 지점에서는 시도해 볼 만한 더 높거나 낮은 엔트로피가 많습니다. 작은 엔트로피는 예상 가능한 구조를 가진 시퀸스를 생성합니다(더 실제처럼 보입니다). 반면에 높은 엔트로피는 놀랍고 창의적인 시퀸스를 만듭니다. 생성 모델에서 샘플링을 할 때 생성 과정에 무작위성의 양을 바꾸어 시도해 보는 것이 좋습니다. 흥미는 매우 주관적이므로 최적의 엔트로피 값을 미리 알 수 없기 때문입니다. 얼마나 흥미로운 데이터를 생성할 것인지는 결국 사람이 판단해야 합니다.\n","\n","샘플링 과정에서 확률의 양을 정하기 위해 소프트맥스 온도라는 파라미터를 사용합니다. 이 파라미터는 샘플링에 사용되는 확률 분포의 엔트로피를 나타냅니다. 얼마나 놀라운 또는 예상되는 글자를 선택할지 결정합니다. temperature값이 주어지면 다음과 같이 가중치를 적용하여 원본 확률 분포에서 새로운 확률 분포를 계산합니다.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"2t1E9j1J8L0T","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1627259765218,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"이현석","photoUrl":"","userId":"05521550356951410326"}}},"source":["import
